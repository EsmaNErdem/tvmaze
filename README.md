# tvmaze
Here is the unit 14.3 AJAX TV maze exercise. In this exercise, I had a chance to exercise more jQuery(hopefully that's it because I like JS dOM manipulation better), bootstrap, and API data extraction. The biggest challenge was figuring out API data responses and finding my way around. But it was all ok in the end. That we why we keep practicing.
